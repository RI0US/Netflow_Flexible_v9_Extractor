# CFLOW Extractor

## How to run

In the latest Netflow versions, there doesn't appear to be a direct method to view Netflow CFLOW data collected using Wireshark. This Python script enables you to process the CFLOW data and export it as a CSV file.

You can run it using ```python cflow_converter.py```, but before that you need to edit the cflow_convertor.py to point to your Wireshark file with CFlow.

An example Wireshark is provided so you can extract and take a look :)
